The project aims to enhance disaster data management for 11 ICPAC countries by integrating API data with the Sendai Framework indicators. Key tasks include listing and filtering disaster data APIs, reviewing and reflecting on this data against Sendai indicators, and visualizing it using a Solara web application with Altair maps. The project involves understanding and documenting the RAG process, familiarizing with ReliefWeb and Large Language Model APIs, and creating a Jupyter Notebook for API access.
